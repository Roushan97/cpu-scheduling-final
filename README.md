# cpu-scheduling-final

Q.6. Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more than 10-time units. CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. CPU is idle for 3-time units and does not entertain any process prior this time. Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of all the processes. Compute average waiting and turnaround time.


Now coming to excute file-- first open terminal complie code with < gcc cse1.c >
then<./a.out> without <> Enter the value as per the question.
